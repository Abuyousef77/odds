Author: Benjamin Bressler
Program name: odd or even
Setup instructions:

Clone repository
Open repository index in web browser
Open webpage
Put any numerical value in the form
Press submit button to display to arrays, one of odd numbers and one of even.
Specifications:
My program, will process the userinput, when the user presses the submit button.
The numerical value put in by the user will then be put into an if function to determine if it is odd or even.
This is done by the modolu, the modulo is used to determine if the number is evenly divisible by two, therefore making it
an even number. In the event it is not divisible by two, my program will determine it is an odd number. The odd & even numbers
are then appended to odds & evens lists.
